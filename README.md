# DevOps Learning Linux Module
This repository documents my journey into the world of Linux fundamentals - from file systems and permissions to networking and scripting - primarily through hands-on learning with the OverTheWire Bandit wargame.

# What I Learned
- An overview of Linux and its role in modern computing.
- How to set up Linux with VirtualBox for a safe, isolated environment.
- Introduction to the terminal — navigating the file system and executing commands.
- How to use 'man' pages to learn more about Linux commands and their options.
- An introduction to shells, their differences, and customizing their appearance (Bash, Zsh).
- Installing Zsh and adding custom themes for a tailored terminal experience.
- An in-depth look at the **Linux File System** — directory structure and key locations.
- The role of sudo — when and why it's used, and its potential risks.
- File permissions and their representation in binary, octal, and string format.
- Environment variables — their significance and the 4 most commonly used ones.
- Hands-on practice to consolidate skills by solving the **OverTheWire Bandit** game and applying everything I learned in a realistic context.
