# DevOps Learning Linux Module
This repository documents my journey into the world of Linux fundamentals - from file systems and permissions to networking and scripting - primarily through hands-on learning with the OverTheWire Bandit wargame.

# What I learnt...
- An overview of Linux and its role in modern computing.
- How to set up Linux with VirtualBox for a safe, isolated environment.
- Introduction to the terminal — navigating the file system and executing commands.
- How to use ```man``` pages to learn more about Linux commands and their options.
- An introduction to shells, their differences, and customizing their appearance (Bash, Zsh).
- Installing Zsh and adding custom themes for a tailored terminal experience.
- An in-depth look at the **Linux File System** — directory structure and key locations.
- The role of ```sudo``` — when and why it's used, and its potential risks.
- File permissions and their representation in binary, octal, and string format.
- Environment variables — their significance and the 4 most commonly used ones.
- Hands-on practice to consolidate skills by solving the **OverTheWire Bandit** game and applying everything I learned in a realistic context.

# OverTheWire Bandit Game - Levels 0 to 20
This challenge was a major step up from theory — putting my Linux fundamentals into practice. Here’s a snapshot of the key skills I learned along the way:

- File operations and directory structure, navigating, reading, and comparing files.
- Using ```diff``` to identify differences in files, a crucial tool for configuration and code reviews.
- Port scanning with ```nmap``` and ```netcat``` (nc) - identifying services and retrieving data over the network.
- SSL/TLS connections with ```openssl``` and ```ncat``` - understanding encrypted services and retrieving credentials safely.
- File permissions and ```chmod 0600``` - securing files with proper access controls.
- SSH fundamentals — accessing remote machines, understanding authentication, and employing custom methods when standard login isn’t available.
- SetUID programs and privilege escalation, safely navigating and utilizing elevated privilege mechanisms to progress through a challenge.
- Environment-specific files and configuration, reading files and understanding their role within the Linux ecosystem.
- General problem-solving and persistence - figuring things out through trial and error, reading ```man``` pages, trying different commands, and following hints.
